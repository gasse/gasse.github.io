I am **Senior Research Scientist** at [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/research/) in Montr√©al, Canada. I am also adjunct professor at [Polytechnique Montreal](https://www.polymtl.ca/), and associate member at the [Mila research institute](https://mila.quebec/mila/). I obtained a PhD on the topic of probabilistic graphical models (with [Haytham Elghazel](https://perso.univ-lyon1.fr/haytham.elghazel/) and [Alex Aussem](https://perso.univ-lyon1.fr/alexandre.aussem/)), and two postdocs on the interdisciplinary topics of machine learning for medical imaging (with [Fabien Milloz](http://www.gipsa-lab.fr/~fabien.millioz/index_en.html) and [Denis Friboulet](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/site7/fr/DenisFriboulet)) and machine learning for combinatorial optimization (with [Laurent Charlin](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/andrea-lodi/) and [Andrea Lodi](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/andrea-lodi/)).

What drives my research is the **understanding of intelligence** through this simple fundamental question: **can machines think?**

My current research projects lie at the intersection of **causal inference** and **reinforcemnent learning**. I am mostly interested in questioning if and how ideas from the field of causality can help in the design of autonomous learning agents:
- how to leverage confounded data in offline RL? (see our [recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14421) and my [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4svj2B4qOE) on causal RL)
- how can counterfactual reasoning be useful in RL?

I am proud to serve the scientific community, and I have been rewarded _NeurIPS 2019 best reviewer_ (top 40%), _ICML 2020 best reviewer_ (top 30%), _NeurIPS 2020 top reviewer_ (top 10%), _ICLR 2021 outstanding reviewer_ (top 10%), and _ICML 2021 expert reviewer_.
