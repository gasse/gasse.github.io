The fundamental question that drives my research is, can machines think ?

I am a researcher at Polytechnique Montr√©al, Canada. I am affiliated to the [Data Science for Real-Time Decision Making](http://cerc-datascience.polymtl.ca) Canada Excellence Research Chair (CERC), and the [MILA](https://mila.quebec/mila/) research institute on artificial intelligence. After obtaining a PhD in computer science dedicated to the problem of structure learning in probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), I have been working on a variety of interdisciplinary topics, such as machine learning and medical imaging, or machine learning and combinatorial optimization. Today I am mostly interested in studying if and how ideas from causality can help in the design of autonomous learning agents.

My broad research interests include:
- **probabilistic graphical models** and their theoretical properties (see my [PhD Thesis](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01442613/document))
- **machine learning for combinatorial optimization** (see our [Ecole](https://www.ecole.ai/) library)
- **causality**, in particular in the context of reinforcement learning (see our [recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14421) on causal RL)

I am proud to serve the scientific community, and I have been rewarded _NeurIPS 2019 best reviewer_ (top 40%), _ICML 2020 best reviewer_ (top 30%), _NeurIPS 2020 top reviewer_ (top 10%), _ICLR 2021 outstanding reviewer_ (top 10%), and _ICML 2021 expert reviewer_.
