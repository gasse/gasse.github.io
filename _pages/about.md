I am a **Senior Research Scientist** at [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/research/) in Montr√©al, Canada, where I do research at the intersection of **causal inference** and **reinforcement learning**. I am an adjunct professor at [Polytechnique Montreal](https://www.polymtl.ca/) (by courtesy), and an associate member of the [Mila research institute](https://mila.quebec/mila/).
<!-- I did my PhD on the topic of probabilistic graphical models with [Haytham Elghazel](https://perso.univ-lyon1.fr/haytham.elghazel/) and [Alex Aussem](https://perso.univ-lyon1.fr/alexandre.aussem/), and two interdisciplinary postdocs in medical imaging with [Fabien Milloz](http://www.gipsa-lab.fr/~fabien.millioz/index_en.html) and [Denis Friboulet](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/site7/fr/DenisFriboulet) and combinatorial optimization with [Laurent Charlin](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/andrea-lodi/) and [Andrea Lodi](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/andrea-lodi/).-->

I am fascinated by the question of artificial intelligence: [can we build machines that think](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop)? I humbly believe that our attempts at designing thinking machines can be a path towards a fundamental understanding of intelligence and of ourselves. Currently I am interested in questioning if and how ideas from the field of [causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_(book)) can help in the design of autonomous learning agents.

- counterfactual reasoning in RL

I am currently Action Editor for TMLR. I am proud to serve the scientific community, and I have been rewarded _NeurIPS 2019 best reviewer_ (top 40%), _ICML 2020 best reviewer_ (top 30%), _NeurIPS 2020 top reviewer_ (top 10%), _ICLR 2021 outstanding reviewer_ (top 10%), _ICML 2021 expert reviewer_, _NeurIPS 2022 top reviewer_ (top 10%), and _TMLR expert reviewer_.
