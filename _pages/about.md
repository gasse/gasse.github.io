I am a researcher at Polytechnique Montréal, Canada, an associate academic member of the [Mila research institute](https://mila.quebec/mila/), and a member of the [Data Science for Real-Time Decision Making](http://cerc-datascience.polymtl.ca) Canada Excellence Research Chair (CERC). I obtained my PhD in 2017 on the topic of structure learning of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), and I have since been working on a variety of interdisciplinary topics, such as machine learning applied to medical imaging, or machine learning applied to combinatorial optimization.

The fundamental question that drives my research is, can machines think ? Today I am mostly interested in questioning if and how causality can help in the design of autonomous learning agents.

My broad scientific interests include:
- **probabilistic graphical models** and their theoretical properties (see my [PhD Thesis](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01442613/document))
- **machine learning for combinatorial optimization** (see our [Ecole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02828) library)
- **causality**, in particular in the context of reinforcement learning (see our [recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14421) and my [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4svj2B4qOE) on causal RL)

I am proud to serve the scientific community, and I have been rewarded _NeurIPS 2019 best reviewer_ (top 40%), _ICML 2020 best reviewer_ (top 30%), _NeurIPS 2020 top reviewer_ (top 10%), _ICLR 2021 outstanding reviewer_ (top 10%), and _ICML 2021 expert reviewer_.
