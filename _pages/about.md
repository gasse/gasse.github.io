I am currently Member of Technical Staff @ Microsoft AI. I am also adjunct professor at [Polytechnique Montreal](https://www.polymtl.ca/) by courtesy, and associate member of the [Mila research institute](https://mila.quebec/mila/).

Before that I was
- Senior Research Scientist at [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/research/), where I did research at the intersection of **causal inference** and **reinforcement learning**, and where I developed the [BrowserGym](https://github.com/ServiceNow/BrowserGym) library to evaluate web agents.
- Researcher and Post-Doc at Polytechnique Montreal, where I worked on machine learning for combinatorial optimization with [Laurent Charlin](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/andrea-lodi/) and [Andrea Lodi](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/andrea-lodi/).
- Post-Doc at INSA Lyon where I worked on machine learning for medical imaging with [Fabien Milloz](http://www.gipsa-lab.fr/~fabien.millioz/index_en.html) and [Denis Friboulet](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/site7/fr/DenisFriboulet).
- PhD student at Universit√© Lyon 1 where I studied probabilistic graphical models with [Haytham Elghazel](https://perso.univ-lyon1.fr/haytham.elghazel/) and [Alex Aussem](https://perso.univ-lyon1.fr/alexandre.aussem/).

I am fascinated by the question of artificial intelligence: [can we build machines that think](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop)? I humbly believe that our attempts at designing thinking machines can be a path towards a fundamental understanding of intelligence and of ourselves. I am interested in questioning if and how ideas from the field of [causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_(book)) can help in the design of autonomous learning agents ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14421), [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4svj2B4qOE)).

I am proud to serve the scientific community, and I am currently Action Editor for TMLR. I have been rewarded _NeurIPS 2019 best reviewer_ (top 40%), _ICML 2020 best reviewer_ (top 30%), _NeurIPS 2020 top reviewer_ (top 10%), _ICLR 2021 outstanding reviewer_ (top 10%), _ICML 2021 expert reviewer_, _NeurIPS 2022 top reviewer_ (top 10%), and _TMLR expert reviewer_.
